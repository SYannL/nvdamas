- Use retrieved memories as evidence-search guidance, not as label priors.
- Prefer a focused Search[...] from the claim, then Lookup[...] key entities or relations in the returned evidence.
- At the final decision, compare the claim against the current evidence: use Finish[SUPPORTS] only for direct entailment, Finish[REFUTES] only for a clear contradiction, and Finish[NOT ENOUGH INFO] when the evidence is missing or ambiguous.
- If a lookup returns No Results, reformulate the evidence query instead of repeating the same lookup.

"""
SECTION_HOW_TO_USE_PDDL = """## How to Use Your Intermediate Findings
- Treat retrieved memories as planning hints over predicates, operators, and goal progress.
- Prefer currently valid actions that move unsatisfied goal literals closer to completion.
- Do not copy object names, operator arguments, or actions that are not available in the current problem.
- If an action fails or stalls, choose a different valid operator rather than repeating the same step.

"""
SECTION_HOW_TO_USE_MTMIND2WEB = """## How to Use Your Intermediate Findings
- Treat retrieved trajectories as reusable interaction patterns on websites (search → filter → sort → open detail → add to cart / book / submit), not as exact HTML.
- Prefer reusing successful action order and control types (textbox vs button vs select) over copying unrelated site-specific wording.
- When the task gives numbered candidate actions, you must only pick indices from that list; do not invent new element labels.
- If memory and the current candidate list conflict, follow the current candidate list and output format rules.
